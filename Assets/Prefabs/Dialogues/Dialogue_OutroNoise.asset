  Text: "Evidence suggests that a well-designed urban green space can buffer the
    noise, or the negative perception of noise, \nemanating from non-natural sources,
    such as traffic, and provide relief from city noise. \n\nVegetation has been
    considered a mean to reduce outdoor noise pollution, \nmainly in areas with high
    volumes of traffic.  "
