  Text: "Trees and vegetation in parks can help reduce air pollution directly by
    removing pollutants and reducing air temperature, both of which contribute to
    smog, and indirectly by reducing energy needs for cooling in surrounding buildings
    and associated pollutant emissions from power plants. \r\n\r\nThe effect of vegetation
    on urban air quality depends on the vegetation itself, its position on the site,
    and overall landscape design, as well as the level of air pollution in the area.
    Since pollution is more concentrated at the source, vegetation should be planted
    close to the source. "
